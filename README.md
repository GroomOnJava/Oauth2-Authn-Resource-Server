# Oauth2-Authn-Resource-Server

This project describes the minimal configuration needed to create a Authn server with Spring-Oauth2 and helps to understand, how a Resource server will authenticate thru bearer token generated by Authn Server.The Authn and Resource server are two separate spring boot projects and need to build in separately.

Note: Here we are using some hard coded user name and password for testing.These details are confiured in UserDetailsConfiguration class in Auth server.
Eg: bill and abc123
