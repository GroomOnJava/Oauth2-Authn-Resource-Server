# Oauth2-Authn-Resource-Server

This project describes the minimal configuration needed to create a Authn server with Spring-Oauth2 configuration and describes how a Resource server will authenticate thru bearer token generated by Authn Server. The Authn and Resource server are two separate spring boot projects and need to build separately.
